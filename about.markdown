<h2>Who am I?</h2>
I'm an indie games developer with a focus on using Godot for 3D games. I'm the co-founder of [Hyperity Studios](https://hyperity.net), and an enthusiast in all things gamedev.

<h2>How did I get here?</h2>
In my early years of highschool, I started dabbling with a little bit of Python programming to help visualise physics activities, specifically plotting projectile motion, an activity that I still benefit from today.

In seniors years, I was introduced to Godot Engine through my ICT classes, of which a task was to make a simple game. At the time, the latest Godot version was 3.1, and my gamedev skills were undeveloped. Still, I was able to make a basic 3d first-person platformer that gave the player different movement buffs depending on what colour platform they landed on.

2021 saw my full-time enrolment in Game Design at the University of the Sunshine Coast, lasting for three years until the end of 2023. During the course, I completed a handful of design, programming, and asset creation classes. I graduated early 2024 with a degree in Game design with a minor in games programming.

In the midst of uni, I founded Hyperity Studios with a friend, which we worked under for a bunch of projects. Hyperity started off as a group making YouTube tutorials for multiplayer video game SCP – Secret Laboratory, a game we were quite fond of at the time. Unfortunately it was entirely volunteer driven, and difficulties with volunteer reliability caused us to shift our focus away from video tutorials. Still in the SCP field, we ran interviews with the developers of popular but cancelled game SCP – Unity, a simple one-off project that resulted in six videos.

After that, we got into game development and tried a few things here and there. Unsurprisingly, our first project was ridiculously over-scoped, even for an established studio, so we as gamedev novices stood no chance, so we refocused our efforts on a puzzle game. It turns out puzzle games are harder to make puzzles for than it is to solve them, and none of us were particularly good at puzzle making. But we still loved making games, so we again refocused our efforts on something slightly smaller. A remake of SCP – Containment Breach. A task that has been tried (and failed) countless times, surely we’d have more success.

Hah. Well sort of. There were a bunch of difficulties that caused major setbacks over the start of the project, but once we got them all settled out, it was somewhat smooth sailing.

And now we’re here, today, still developing games with a passion.

<h2>What do I do?</h2>
I primarily develop [Traversion](https://hyperity.net/traversion.html), originally my capstone project from university, and [SCP – Containment Breach Reborn](https://hyperity.net/cbr.html), the focus of Hyperity.

Occasionally I’ll get a spark of inspiration and pull up a new project and experiment a bit to see what I can learn, things that might migrate their way into a blog post.

Aside from that? I participate in weekly gamedev meetups at my local library, I occasionally attend the Squiggly river's monthly meetups in Brisbane, and I try to make it to the major games events like the Queensland Games Festival.
