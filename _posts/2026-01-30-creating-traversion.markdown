During the final year of university, the capstone for the Game Design degree was to create a video game. In a group of four, my team started with ambition. We agreed to create a first-person-shooter located in rural Australia, using Unreal Engine. And if you’re thinking ‘Gee Scordi, that sounds nothing like the Traversion I know!’, well, you’d be right...

About halfway through the year, at the start of the second semester, the team and the lecturer had a chat. Basically, we concluded that we weren’t confident in completing what we thought we could, and scrapped the idea completely. We were back to the drawing board, but I pitched the idea of a movement platformer, and over a few weeks, we planned out what Traversion is today. However, we didn’t start actually developing the game until about the fourth week of the second semester. At this stage, pretty much every other group was well underway with their own projects, while we were back to square one.

However, after doing the gamedev equivalent of snorting crack, we got to work. By the end of the third week, we had a basic framework. It wasn’t great, it wasn’t complex, but it worked. It covered player movement, rockets and blast jumping, checkpoints and killboxes. The fundamentals that we built the prototype levels around.

But the first few days also added a single script that I still use today. The ConfigHandler script, a back end system for reading and writing player configurations. Keybinds, graphics settings, mouse and audio options. Of course, ConfigHandler would later undergo revision after revision, but we’ll get to that another time.

Traversion, at just a few days old, looked pretty terrible. Not really a surprise, since all we had were a few cubes to test stuff with, but it led to another issue. Our team didn’t have anybody who specialised in asset creation. The low poly style we ‘chose’ was really the only option we had at the time, and without texture artists, we went with flat vertex colouring over texturing. The end result wasn’t pretty, but it was functional, and for a bunch of programmers, that was good enough for us.

Over about six weeks, we developed around twenty playable levels, added features like the grappling hook and the slowfall ability, and got the university tutor to playtest. If you’ve seen any of the old Traversion media, which you likely have, as at the time of writing this we haven’t replaced them with new ones yet. Old Traversion was bland. Flat and undetailed surfaces messed with depth perception, and the player movement was generic.

Still, we launched on steam for $3 AUD as the semester concluded. We got a few sales, more than we expected, less than we hoped. In hindsight, it’s surprising we got any with our quality of promotional media.

After university finished, the team stopped focusing on the project as we all drifted off into our own lives, although occasionally there’d be a contribution. Two years later, around the middle of 2025, I bought ownership of the project from the rest of the team, and continued to work on it in my own time.

Since graduation, I overhauled the menus, the movement systems, the visual style, and the existing levels. Playtesting run by Minirow, the Hyperity co-director, helped to refine the gameplay and feel, creating a much more enjoyable experience.
